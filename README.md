## ðŸ““ Markito

Markito is a tool to create, edit and share Markdown content. I named it Markito because of the [Markdown](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) language, my good old friend (_Marcos or Marquitos_ ðŸ˜Š), and the old and renowned Roman Emperor: [_Marcus Aurelius_](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marcus-Aurelius-Roman-emperor). 

To know more go and see the [live version of Markito](https://markito-production.up.railway.app).
